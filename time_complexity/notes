I learned decently in this module. I particularly liked :
 - number of iterations in second loop is equal to iteration counter in first
   loop - then it will be '1+2+3+..n' = O(n^2)
 - The Amortized problem - where max only 'N' checks will happen - thus even
   with two loops - complexity is O(n)
 - GCD problem which I didn't understand
 - opposite of first case - where u start with 'N' and in second loop u go
   till 1st iteration counter. and in each iteration u decrease it by half
 - all recursive problems. I have to understand them more.

All the above cases can be found in bookmark section of InterviewBit
