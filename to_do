This doc will contain all the things which I need to cover. As and when I do
it, I will mark it as done.

---Time complexity
 - RAM model of computation
 - Asymptotic notations(more idea on that)
 - Recursive problems - time complexity calculation/visualization
   -> for every recursive problem u solve calculate TC
   -> this will improve u in that area - u r weak!
